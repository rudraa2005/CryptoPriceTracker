# CryptoPriceTracker
This project is built in Go. It was created to learn how to develop APIs using Go, handle HTTP requests, and organize code into functions and packages effectively. The project demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, with API logic in the crypto package and HTTP route handling in the main server file.
